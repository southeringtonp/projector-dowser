
# What is this?

This is a proof-of-concept (but verified working) assembly
to create a projector dowser. It is controllable via DMX for
theatrical use, though has not (yet) been tested in a live
production.

This is a personal project and no warrantee or guarantee of any
kind is given. Use at your own risk.

A dowser can be built for under $100 with this approach, and
with some more work more cost can be shaved off. Commercially
versions typically run for $100 or more, though you likely
get what you pay for.

You will need a 3D Printer and assorted off-the-shelf parts. If you
want to edit the CAD files directly, you'll also need a recent copy
of Vectorworks, though you may be able to import the files into
other CAD software.

*There seem to be different revisions of this out there. You may need to make
slight adjustments to the Arduino code and/or the 3d printed case top if you
have a different revision.

**for prototyping; a more permanent solution is recommended if you're going do to
this for serious work.
